## Testing
Used Rspec for testing. Created multiple tests for each model to ensure proper functioning. Also ran repeated user tests while creating the app so that we could find issues as we went.

To run rspec tests:
- Navigate in terminal to the random-maze-game folder.
- Navigate into the src folder.
- Enter 'rspec' into terminal.

## Ethical Issues:
- Taking over the world and destroying lives because it is so addictive.
- Excessive playing of this game may result in negative emotional, social and relational consequences.
- [Addiction Help](https://www.psychguides.com/guides/video-game-addiction-symptoms-causes-and-effects/)

## Accessibility Requirements:
- Game requires ability to give input with keyboard.
- Game uses default terminal colour for displaying maze and menu options. Can change your default terminal colour if colour blindness is an issue.
- Game does not require the use of sound.
- Unfortunately game would not work for people with vision problems as text to speech for this kind of game would not be possible.

## Challenges:
- The hardest part was the random maze generation.
- Fixing our endless recursion nightmare.
- Finding out how to use the arrow keys.
- Making the player icon unable to move through the walls.
