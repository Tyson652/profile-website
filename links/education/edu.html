      <h3>University</h3>
      I went to University of Technology Sydney where I studied a Bachelor of Science, Mathematics. I completed my first year, however I decided to leave the course in order to do the bootcamp at Coder Academy. I decided that I was more interested in pursuing a career in web development rather then a career in Mathematics.
